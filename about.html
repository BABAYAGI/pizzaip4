            <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
            <P>
                In 1918 Eastbrowns came to England from Italy. After a few years working as a laborer, we
                decided to do what he had done in our native Italy. "Bake Bread". The best and only way, we said, was to
                bake it in a brick oven. So along with a few of our friends we built our 20' by 20' brick oven. The
                bread business went well until the outbreak of World War II when all of my sons who had helped me in
                the business were drafted into military
                In 1992, we realized that our oven, which had given us 72 years of service, needed a face-lift. We never
                thought that was supposed to be a 3 month "project" would turn out to be a 7 month "nightmare". Thanks
                to your loyal patronage The Tacconelli family, now in its 5th generation, is still baking tomato pies
                the Giovanni Tacconelli way.

                Please keep in mind we are a one-man, one-oven operation. Waiting time may vary. Please be assured each
                pie is made fresh and to order.
            </P>

                        <P>Gordon Ramsay is a British chef whose restaurants have been awarded 16 Michelin stars in
                            total. Though a young Gordon had aspirations of becoming a football player, an injury ended
                            his hopes of establishing a promising career in football. He then went back to college to
                            complete a course in hotel management and trained with some of the world’s leading chefs,
                            such as Albert Roux and Marco Pierre White in London, and Guy Savoy and Joël Robuchon in
                            France. He became the head chef of ‘Aubergine,’ which was awarded two Michelin stars within
                            three years.
